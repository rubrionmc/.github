                            Version 1, 2025

 Copyright (C) 2025 Rubrion <https://rubrion.net/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble
The Rubrion Public License (RPL) is a permissive, attribution-focused
license for software and other creative works.

Unlike restrictive licenses, RPL is designed to let you use,
modify, and share the work freely, while still encouraging
acknowledgment of the original authors. You can apply it to
your programs or derivative works.

When we speak of "freedom," we mean the freedom to copy,
share, and adapt, not price. This license ensures that you can
distribute copies, access source code, modify works, and know
you can do these things responsibly.

To respect the rights of the original creators, you should
declare original authorship in derivative works or distributions.

Developers that use RPL protect your rights by giving you
legal permission to copy, distribute, and/or modify their works,
while disclaiming any warranty or liability.

This license also discourages obscuring or hiding the origin
of the work (e.g., obfuscation without attribution).

                   Terms and Conditions

Definitions:

"This License" refers to version 1 of the Rubrion Public License.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
this License. "You" refers to the licensee. "Use" includes
running, copying, distributing, or modifying the work.

Source Code:

The "source code" is the preferred form for making modifications.
"Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

Permissions:

You may use, copy, modify, and distribute the Program freely,
provided that you give reasonable attribution to the original
authors, for example in an "about" dialog, console output, or
metadata in digital files. You are encouraged, but not required,
to include the RPL License notice in derivative works.

No Warranty:

The Program is provided "as is," without any warranty of any
kind. The authors disclaim any liability for damages arising
from its use.

Anti-Circumvention:

You should not obscure or misrepresent the origin of the work.
Practices like code obfuscation without attribution are discouraged.

The Rubrion Public License encourages attribution and sharing
while remaining simple and flexible for developers.
